# LCA-Of-Binary-Tree
The provided code recursively finds the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes p and q in a binary tree. It checks if the current node is p or q, or if p and q are found in its left and right subtrees. The first node from which both recursive calls return a non-null value is the LCA.
